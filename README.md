# Tic-Tac-Toe ðŸŒž

Go ahead and play the game if you love TV shows (well, who doesn't anyway?), that will show you how well you know the industry.
I tried to do a mix up of the most well-know TV shows for the last 20 years or so, but there still might be some you do not not, because of the prejudices view and a want to put my favourites in here.

Hope you enjoy it!

### Challenges faced and things learned during development

- Played around with css gradients to create a pattern for the background
- Created a couple of very simple anumations to make a game a bit more pleasing to the eye
